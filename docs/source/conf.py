# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'profile-readme'
copyright = '2020, Robert-96'
author = 'Robert-96'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
    'sphinx_rtd_theme',
    'sphinx_click',
    'recommonmark'
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:
source_suffix = {
    '.rst': 'restructuredtext',
    '.md': 'markdown'
}

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = []


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ['_static']

# If given, this must be the name of an image file (path relative to the configuration
# directory) that is the favicon of the docs. Modern browsers use this as the icon for
# tabs, windows and bookmarks. It should be a Windows-style icon file (.ico), which is
# 16x16 or 32x32 pixels large.
html_favicon = '_static/logo.svg'

# If given, this must be the name of an image file (path relative to the configuration
# directory) that is the logo of the docs. It is placed at the top of the sidebar;
# its width should therefore not exceed 200 pixels.
html_logo = '_static/logo.svg'
